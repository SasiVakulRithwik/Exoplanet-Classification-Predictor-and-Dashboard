## üìä Project Overview

The *Exoplanet Classification Dashboard* is an advanced machine learning system designed to classify celestial objects detected by NASA's Kepler mission into three categories: confirmed exoplanets, candidate exoplanets, and false positives. This project demonstrates the practical application of data science methodologies to solve complex astronomical classification problems.

By analyzing astronomical data from NASA's Exoplanet Archive, our model provides valuable insights for:

- *Automated Classification* - Rapid identification of potential exoplanets from transit signals
- *Research Efficiency* - Reducing manual verification time for astronomers
